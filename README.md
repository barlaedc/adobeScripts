# adobeScripts
a collection of scripts used to automate some process'

## installation

Most of the scripts here are JSX (Adobe's JavaScript files) and can be copied directly to the relavent applications script directory

TBD: add links for the main applications on how to do that

## Reason for these scripts

These scripts are created for a specific purpose, normally because I need a new document with certain things and have to redo it constantly so create a script to do it for me. Others are just variations on the script to learn about a new technology or method that is available in the Adobe Suite.
